# Parkinsons Prediction Challenge
Use protein and peptide data measurements from Parkinson's Disease patients to predict progression of the disease.

# GOAL
The goal of this competition is to predict the course of Parkinson's disease (PD) using protein abundance data.
Evaluate each patient over a time series of 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. 
My approach uses Linear Regression, Tree Regression, and Neural Networking to assess a Parkinson's 'updrs' numbers. 
These numbers, 1-4, are risk levels of a patient developing Parkinsons and the higher the number, the higher the risk. 
I use SMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute % Error) to determine the accuracy of these models as well.


# Data 
The Data is split into 3 files, the Peptides, Proteins, and Clinical data.
